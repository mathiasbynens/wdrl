Ho ho ho,<br>
<br>
it's Advent season and this is already the 20th(!) issue of WDRL. 

Hopefully you're not stressed by Christmas already and have some spare time. I recommend to test your knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript by playing this [Front-End Development Quiz](http://davidshariff.com/quiz/). Takes you about 15 minutes but is pretty helpful to know what skills you may improve.


### News

- [Google Chrome supports Custom Elements](http://src.chromium.org/viewvc/blink?view=revision&revision=162775) in its next stable build

### Tools

- Chrome people, install this [extension to hide W3Schools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/w3schools-hider/igiahejkpbnbnekdaefddmdceocmjpll) from search results. [Why?](http://www.w3fools.com/)
- [`z-index` rewriter](https://github.com/phuu/z-index-rewrite).
- [Prune](http://prune.io/) automatically tests code of GitHub Pull Requests and shows you the diff when an error occurs.

### HTML

- [Building for the Device agnostic Web](http://decadecity.net/talks/building-for-the-device-agnostic-web).
- Anne van Kesteren wishes [the browser to be the main part of an OS](http://the-pastry-box-project.net/anne-van-kesteren/2013-december-2/). This needs us to think more about device features, offline usage, and APIs.
- [Coding Towards Accessibility](http://24ways.org/2013/coding-towards-accessibility/). And don't forget, [it's a myth that accessibility is only about blind](http://a11yproject.com/posts/myth-accessibility-is-blind-people/) people.
- [HTML5 Browser Storage: the Past, Present and Future](http://www.sitepoint.com/html5-browser-storage-past-present-future/).

### Performance Matters

- [Choose your CDN name carefully](http://chrishateswriting.com/post/68794699432/small-things-add-up) to save bytes. 4Chan saves 46 terabytes per month due to that small fact.
- Microsoft shares the [IE11 Prefetching and Preloading methods](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2013/12/04/getting-to-the-content-you-want-faster-in-ie11.aspx) in this blog post. It shows how you and the browser can serve faster websites.

### CSS

- [VJing in a modern browser](http://24ways.org/2013/make-your-browser-dance/) using CSS Animations, requestAnimationFrame, and the Audio API.
- While developing a Responsive Design optimizing it for all the smaller than Desktop devices, [never forget about the larger screens](http://alistapart.com/article/surveying-the-big-screen).
- [Animating `display: block` and `display: none`](http://www.impressivewebs.com/animate-display-block-none/). It's hacky, you should avoid that but let's you understand why it won't work with CSS.
- [Create textured text](http://tympanus.net/codrops/2013/12/02/techniques-for-creating-textured-text/).
- Wohoa! This little script let's you target nearly all browser where you encounter a bug. Just [set user agent classes](http://rog.ie/blog/html5-boilerplate-addon).

### JavaScript

- Here is a piece [how you can improve your JavaScript knowledge easily](http://24ways.org/2013/javascript-taking-off-the-training-wheels/).
- Measuring execution times with [`console.time()`](http://blog.mariusschulz.com/2013/11/22/measuring-execution-times-in-javascript-with-consoletime).
- [enquire.js](http://wicky.nillia.ms/enquire.js/#quick-start) is a lightweight Media Query handler for JavaScript.
- Always wanted a search, sort, filter thing for your lists and tables? There's now [list.js](http://listjs.com/) to your service.

### Things on the Server that affect the Front-End 

- [Don’t mess with the Web](https://speakerdeck.com/slexaxton/practicing-safe-script). Practice Safe Script by Alex Sexton.
- On 24ways this article is about [URL Rewriting for the Fearful](http://24ways.org/2013/url-rewriting-for-the-fearful/). It explains the basics and advanced cool things you can rewrite using a server configuration file. 
- Related to that, here is a [`.htaccess` snippet page](http://www.cssreflex.com/language/htaccess/).
- And finally, Peter Müller currently develops a [CSP auto generator](https://github.com/Munter/contentsecure). If you can, contribute to it.
- Homebrew now [supports Brewfiles](https://coderwall.com/p/afmnbq).
- Google shared some numbers about [how SPDY2 and HTTP/2 affect website performance](http://blog.chromium.org/2013/11/making-web-faster-with-spdy-and-http2.html).

### Be inspired by…

- Jeremy Keith who transcripted his talk "[The Power Of Simplicity](http://adactio.com/articles/6574/)" from the [border:none](https://vimeo.com/79556632) conference.
- Dudley Storey who wants to [thank all the underrated developers](http://demosthenes.info/blog/791/Being-Thankful-For-The-Web) who created things that we use every day for our websites but often forget about (like Apache). 
- John. He has important things to say&mdash;it's about [the other web we lost](http://www.webdirections.org/blog/the-other-web-we-lost/).

Finally, you can now nominate people, tools and projects for the 2014 netwards: [thenetawards.com](http://thenetawards.com/) – great to see new categories this year.
