Hey,<br>
<br>
I’m sorry about the delayed letter this week. Unfortunately I hadn’t had a good week and my grandpa passed away.<br>
Apart from that, I hope all of you enjoyed easter and you weren’t too distracted by the recent discussion on sexism in web dev industry. But we’re not here to talk about this, you probably just want to have the latest facts in web technology:

### News

- The IE team shares the [DevTools news shipped in Windows 8.1 Update](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2014/04/14/what-s-new-in-f12-with-windows-8-1-update.aspx), including emulation of pseudo-states, change states and more.
- [Opera Max (Beta)](http://blogs.opera.com/news/2014/04/opera-max-now-available-russia-ukraine/) for Android is a data saver that compresses not only webpages but also videos and photos to save your mobile data traffic.
- You soon will be able to [deactivate the Chrome notification icon in your OS X menubar](https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=305398).
- Firefox will [support `line-height` in input buttons](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=697451) soon.

### General stuff

- [Stripe invites 3 people to code on their own Open Source project](https://stripe.com/blog/stripe-open-source-retreat) ideas in their SF headquarter and pays for it. A very interesting and good idea.

### Design

- [How Stripe improves the payment experience with animations](https://medium.com/p/3d1b0a9b810e). Really, they’re pretty clever and I always like paying via Stripe.

### Tools

### Git

### Web Performance

- [How GZIP Compression works](http://blog.servergrove.com/2014/04/14/gzip-compression-works/). It’s a good refresher what gzip is, how it works, what features and what disadvantages it has. Becuase in fact, it’s only the best compromise.

### HTML

- [WTF, HTML and CSS?](http://wtfhtmlcss.com/) Reasons HTML and CSS might make you say what the fuck. A curated list of commonly frustrating HTML and CSS quandaries, miscues, and dilemmas.

### JavaScript

- [Picturefill 2.0](http://scottjehl.github.io/picturefill/) is out and now is not only serving the proper final syntax but has been completely refactored and modularized.
- [HTML5Shiv now ships with `<picture>`](https://github.com/aFarkas/html5shiv/commit/c163f8d0668cc37ff72083f40d128753d7e817cb) element support.

- CSS might get a [`contain-floats` value](http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css-sizing/#the-contain-floats-value) for `min-height` and `min-width` which as the name says, will include floated elements into the container’s size.
- [Element Queries from the feet up](http://www.backalleycoder.com/2014/04/18/element-queries-from-the-feet-up/).
- [The Shadow DOM Cheat Sheet](http://robdodson.me/blog/2014/04/10/shadow-dom-css-cheat-sheet/) is really useful if you want to style your Web Components. But be careful, you should always [keep in mind what it means to create a web component](http://christianheilmann.com/2014/04/18/web-components-and-you-dangers-to-avoid/).
- [CSS Variables syntax for Rework](https://github.com/reworkcss/rework-vars) landed.

### Go beyond…

- [Treehouse is working only four days a week and doing pretty fine](http://money.cnn.com/2014/04/22/smallbusiness/treehouse-four-day-workweek/index.html), half of it working remotely.
