Hola!<br>
<br>
A week in web development never stops producing new stuff and that’s why I can send you these emails every week containing many great tools and articles. This week is about browser news, a few cool new techniques, tools and some important articles about workflows, project management and improving the way to work.

### News

- [Firefox 29 shipped this week](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/Firefox/Releases/29) and brought the beautiful Australis UI to everyone out there. With it, major DevTools improvements landed, CSS Variables support, unprefixed `box-sizing`, `will-change` (for animated objects), `<input type="color">` are all now supported. That’s a big release!
- If you wonder how browser vendors decide if to implement a new web platform feature, here is a [document to guide Blink developers](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i9gYiufYAEe3ibARlP0x6WDe0qcxzFIC5uYZWo0ojKI/edit?pli=1).
- [IE8 is still the most used browser world-wide](http://thenextweb.com/insider/2014/05/01/ie11-market-share-passes-ie10-ie9-combined-chrome-cements-lead-firefox/).
- [AppLinks](http://applinks.org/) helps you to link to mobile apps from your website.

### General stuff

- Thoughts on [“I’m not your recruiter”](https://medium.com/editors-picks/d2da2fe50f7a) and on helping others to form their business for free.
- [The way we build the internet is changing](http://inside.envato.com/the-way-we-build-the-internet-is-changing/). Envato shares this article about smaller frameworks, components, living styleguides and other changes lately in our industry.
- [Nicole Sullivan on optimizing code](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/nicole-sullivan-value-optimising-code-41411428) and get started to improve your skills by reading webstandards.
- [How do web experts manage cross platform testing](http://www.creativebloq.com/netmag/how-do-web-experts-manage-cross-platform-testing-51411505)?

### Design

- How to [create a nice, readable typographic experience](http://typecast.com/blog/readable-fluid-type-with-basic-css-smarts) using some CSS and em-values.

### Tools

- [`stream-throttle`](https://github.com/tjgq/node-stream-throttle) is a nodejs tool that can throttle your network connection. There’s also a [grunt plugin](https://github.com/tjgq/grunt-throttle) so you can test your grunt project.
- Use [grunt to directly publish to gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.org/package/grunt-gh-pages).

### Git

- These are some useful [Git tips you probably didn’t know](http://nigelb.me/2014-04-26-git-tips-you-probably-did-not-know.html). For example, for comparing your branch to the current master use `git diff master...` instead of `git diff master`.
- [How to deal with merge conflicts](http://css-tricks.com/deal-merge-conflicts-git/).

### HTML

- [Get started with web accessibility](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/monika-piotrowicz/2014-April-29#)
- A great slide deck on [Digital self-defense](http://fhemberger.github.io/talks/web-security/en.html#/cover)—mitigate clickjacking and XSS attacks with HTTP Headers.

### JavaScript

- [Velocity.js](http://julian.com/research/velocity/) is a jQuery plugin that handles animation methods of jQuery, but just way better performance-wise.
- Chrome removed the click delay recently but this is [now causing other issues like custom swipe gestures not working anymore](http://wilsonpage.co.uk/touch-events-in-chrome-android/). Because you now have to call `event.preventDefault()` within 200ms. That’s why pointer events are so much better.
- Be careful using [jQuery’s `trigger()` function and be aware what to do if this doesn’t work](http://aerotwist.com/blog/trigger-vs-triggerHandler-in-jQuery/) as expected.
- [Tests, like any code, should be deleted when their cost exceeds their value](http://benjiweber.co.uk/blog/2014/04/27/delete-your-tests/). Stay sane testing your web applications.

### CSS

- Sara Soueidan wrote a [CSS Shapes 101](http://alistapart.com/article/css-shapes-101) on A List Apart. Quite helpful.
- How to [tailor your CSS for performance](http://programming.oreilly.com/2014/04/tailoring-css-for-performance.html) by asynchronously loading e.g. background-images.
- Create [adaptive placeholders](http://blog.circleci.com/adaptive-placeholders/) for your form fields. They can massively improve the user experience.
- [Understanding CSS timing functions](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/04/15/understanding-css-timing-functions/) from the ground up.

### Go beyond…

- [Work Life Balance: What changes could help improve yours?](http://www.theguardian.com/education/2014/apr/09/new-work-life-balance-france-sweden-laws-countries-better-job-hours-work) Sweden tests the 6hrs day, based on the success of a 4day week.
- [Perfectionism is a beast](https://the-pastry-box-project.net/roz-duffy/2014-April-26#) or why finishing things is hard.
- Frank Chimero and his plan to [not install, buy or create new tools](http://frankchimero.com/blog/no-new-tools/) but only making his work instead.
- [Email considered harmful](http://boingboing.net/2014/04/28/email-considered-harmful.html) and impacting your work productivity.
- [“Do it once, do it right”](https://medium.com/p/260b6de30a48)—some good thoughts on agile processes and iterations. Because iteration needs to be built into your product timelines.
- [What your Project Manager should and has to do](https://medium.com/the-year-of-the-looking-glass/1229723a4501) for your team and why you probably don’t want to be in this role.
